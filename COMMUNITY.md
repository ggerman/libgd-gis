# libgd-gis Community

libgd-gis is a native GIS and map rendering engine for Ruby.  
It provides map projections, layers, icons, labels, and tile-grade raster output built on top of ruby-libgd.

This community exists to:
- help people render real maps with Ruby
- share datasets, scripts, and examples
- guide the roadmap of Ruby-based GIS

---

## 💬 Where to talk

We use **GitHub Discussions** as the main community hub:

👉 https://github.com/ggerman/libgd-gis/discussions

Use Discussions for:
- “How do I render this map?”
- “What projection should I use?”
- “How can I draw streets, labels, or polygons?”
- “What GIS features are missing?”

Use GitHub **Issues** only for:
- bugs
- concrete feature requests

## 🗺 Show your maps

If you generate maps with libgd-gis, please share:
- screenshots
- rendered tiles
- scripts
- GeoJSON or CSV datasets

Seeing real-world maps helps improve projections, labeling, and rendering quality.

## 🧭 Project direction

libgd-gis is focused on:
- fast native raster rendering
- predictable geographic projections
- tile-friendly output
- street maps, POIs, and data visualization

The goal is to make Ruby a serious platform for GIS, mapping, and spatial data rendering.

## 🤝 Code of collaboration

We expect all participants to be:
- respectful
- constructive
- focused on improving map quality and correctness

This is a technical, professional open source community for people who care about maps and data.
